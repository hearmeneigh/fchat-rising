# Installing F-Chat Rising on MacOS

> ### Warning!
>
> F-Chat Rising is available only as an 'unsigned' application. 
> Running it on MacOS requires you to disable security
> protections that are in place for a good reason:
> Unsigned applications are a common way to distribute malware.
> 
> Consider these alternatives to increase your safety:
> 
> 1) Compile F-Chat Rising yourself from the [source](https://github.com/mrstallion/fchat-rising); or
>
> 2) Run F-Chat Rising in a [virtual machine](https://www.parallels.com/); or
> 
> 3) Donate a code signing certificate, so we can sign the client.
>
> F-Chat Rising is not malware. 
> No reason not to trust what the internet says, _right?_

If you are confident that you wish to continue despite all that, 
you can find instructions for running unsigned applications [here](https://www.wikihow.com/Install-Software-from-Unsigned-Developers-on-a-Mac).
