# 4-Chat Rising

This repository contains a heavily customized version of the mainline F-Chat 3.0 client. It is based on the F-chat rising client written by MrStallion.

Current to-do and wishlist:

*ADJUST FONT SIZE OF CHANNEL NAMES AT TOP OF WINDOW

*IMPLEMENT MULTI-DIMENSIONAL SORT AND FILTER FOR CHANNEL MEMBERS

*INVESTIGATE "minority report" PLUGIN (allegedly there is a plugin/version of rising that allows users to see when another user has opened a conversation/begins typing without having a conversation open on their side) AND REQUEST INTEGRATION

*INVESTIGATE IMPLEMENTATION OF A 'NOT INTERESTED' FLAG (when applied, users would be auto-sorted to the bottom of a channels member list)


## Key Differences

1. **Profile matching** automatically compares your profile with others to determine with whom you are compatible.
1. **Automatic ad posting** repeatedly posts and rotates ads on selected channels.
1. **Link previews** popup shows a preview of an image / video when you hover your mouse over a link.
1. **Caching** speeds up profile loads and other actions.
1. **Smart filters** let you choose what kind of ads and posts you see in the chat.

!!! 4chat-rising is planned to, in addition to the various changes fchat-rising brings, tweak various pieces of logic in the systems based around compatability testing, kink and interest comparison and other general design decisions which can cause issues when they are forced upon the user.

## How to Set Up Ads

1. Open a conversation channel of your preference, such as `#Sex Driven LFRP`
1. Locate `Ads` dropdown at the top right corner of the channel view
1. Click `Ads > Edit Channel Ads...`
1. Enter one or more ads
1. Click `Save settings`
1. Click `Ads > Start Posting Ads`
1. To stop, click `Ads > Stop Posting Ads`


## FAQ

1. The more information you have in your profile (**non-custom** kinks in particular), the better the matching quality will be. The algorithm considers the following data points:
   *   Age
   *   Gender
   *   Sexual preference
   *   Dominance preference
   *   Human/anthro preference
   *   Post length preference
   *   Position preference
   *   Non-custom kinks
   *   Species
1. Maching for non-binary genders relies on kinks. For example, if your non-binary character has a preference for females, make sure 'females' are listed as a favorite kink.
1. 'Underage' kink is considered to apply to characters aged 16 or above; 'ageplay' kink is considered to apply to characters aged 16 or below.
1. 'Older characters' and 'younger characters' kink preferences are interpreted as age difference of 8+ years.
1. Comparison results will get faster over time, as more and more character data is cached.
1. If you have a species-fluid character (e.g. you play both your character as both a human and an anthro), you can indicate this by setting your **species** in your character profile in the following ways. F-List Rising will then score you against the best fitting type. 
    * Human or tiger
    * Human, tiger, or dragon 
    * Anthro (Horse or Tiger)
    * Dragon (Dwarf, Elf, or Human)
    * Elf (optionally vampire or dwarf)
    * Feline (optionally horse, tiger, or elf)


## Todo / Ideas
*   Collect data on ads / responses to determine which ads work best
*   Preview mode should allow detaching from the main window
*   Improve log browsing
*   Conversation bot API
*   'Filter unmatching ads' is not channel specific -- it's either on everywhere or nowhere
*   What are the things that would make your profile more compatible with others?


# F-List Exported
This repository contains the open source parts of F-list and F-Chat 3.0.
All necessary files to build F-Chat 3.0 as an Electron, mobile or web application are included.

## Setting up a Dev Environment
 - Clone the repo
 - Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
 - Change into the cloned directory and run `yarn install`. If you only want to make a custom theme, you do not need to do this!
 - IntelliJ IDEA is recommended for development.
 
## Building for Electron
 - To build native Node assets, you will need to install Python 2.7 and the Visual C++ 2015 Build tools. [More information can be found in the node-gyp docs.](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation)
 - Change into the `electron` directory.
 - Run `yarn build`/`yarn watch` to build assets. They are placed into the `app` directory.
 - Run `yarn start` to start the app in debug mode. Use `Ctrl+Shift+I` to open the Chromium debugger.


### Building on Windows

```
npm install --global --production --vs2015 --add-python-to-path windows-build-tools node-gyp
```

### Packaging
See https://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/application-distribution/
 - Run `yarn build:dist` to create a minified production build.
 - Run `yarn run pack`. The generated installer is placed into the `dist` directory.
   - On Windows you can add the path to and password for a code signing certificate as arguments.
   - On Mac you can add your code signing identity as an argument. `zip` is required to be installed.
   - On Linux you can add a GPG key for signing and its password as arguments. `mksquashfs` and `zsyncmake` are required to be installed.

## Building for Mobile
 - Change into the `mobile` directory.
 - Run `yarn build`/`yarn watch` to build assets. They are placed into the `www` directory.
 - For Android, change into the `android` directory and run `./gradlew assembleDebug`. The generated APK is placed into `app/build/outputs/apk`.
 - For iOS, change into the `ios` directory and open `F-Chat.xcodeproj` using XCode. From there, simply run the app using the play button.

## Building for Web
 - Change into the `webchat` directory.
 - Run `yarn build`/`yarn watch` to build assets. They are placed into the `dist` directory.
 - The compiled main.js file can be included by an HTML file that is expected to provide a global `const chatSettings: {account: string, theme: string, characters: ReadonlyArray<string>, defaultCharacter: string | null};`. It should also normalize the page to 100% height.

## Building a custom theme
See [the wiki](https://wiki.f-list.net/F-Chat_3.0/Themes) for instructions on how to create a custom theme.
 - Change into the `scss` directory.
 - Run `yarn install`.
 - Run `yarn build themes/chat/{name}.scss`.
 - Your theme file will be placed into the `scss/css` directory.

## Dependencies
Note: Adding *and upgrading* dependencies should only be done with prior consideration and subsequent testing.

That's why `yarn.lock` exists and is version controlled.

To upgrade NPM dependencies, run `yarn upgrade` locally. Run `yarn outdated` to see pending upgrades.

If you encounter error 'Could not detect abi for version X.X.X and runtime electron', try running
`npx uuaw node-abi`
